# so_long
so_long:
my so_long was a masterpiece:
the aim of the game is to recover organs, so you'll be able to pick up lots of them. If you're running the bonus mode, you'll have enemies to eliminate with the space bar, and recover their organs instead of, or in addition to, the basic ones. Watch out for enemy groupings.
this so_long is compatible with all types of keyboard.
